I’m @PabloCEng, I'm a chemical engineer currently doing my masters degree interested in honing my skills at programming and any other computational tool for research 
porpuses. Having being involved in some research projects made me realize the great value that lies in computional chemistry and engineering as a whole, lots of resources
are invested throughout experiments and part of them can be saved with the help of software simulations. Conclusions arrived through computational tools are of great 
help in finding profitable lines of research at the same time with reject those that aren't. 

My main lines of work currently are; reactor designing, chemical kinetics and analysis of experimental data. I also like, transfer phenomena and chemical/physical 
equilibrium. It is a plus is everything aforementioned is oriented towards the study of biofuels.

I'm learning Python, Fortran, Octave and R. I'm somehow at a intermidiate level when it comes to programming and I'm hoping to get better at it. Other tools I've used
are; minitab, Avogadro and maxima.
